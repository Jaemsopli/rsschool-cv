The purpose of my training is to acquire skills in the field of information technology with the prospect of obtaining a highly paid position. I want to be able to work remotely so that I can travel the world without breaking away from my work. I think this is important because there aren't many jobs in the world that allow us to be mobile.

At the moment, I have no programming experience, but I try to get it.. Take Up skill Lab courses from EPAM. I have a law degree. He graduated from Baranovichi State University in 2016. At the moment, I do not know English. I work with a translator. In the future, start studying. :)
